# Setting up your development environment

There are a few different options to get started:

## 1\. Manual setup for experienced developers (i.e. using an existing development environment):

### Install prerequisites

- MySQL 5.7
- PHP 7.1+ (with curl, gd, intl, json, mbstring, mcrypt, mysql, xml and zip extensions)
- nginx (or other webserver)
- Node.js 8 or 9 (and a modern version of npm)
- elasticsearch 5+
- redis (not required, but you may want to use for caching and laravel's job-queue)

### Clone the git repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ppy/osu-web.git
```

### Configure .env file

```bash
# copy the example file and edit the settings, the important ones are APP_* and DB_*
$ cp .env.example .env
$ vi .env
```

### URL rewriting

```nginx
# for nginx, with root set to the `public` folder of the repo
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
}
```

Consult the [laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/installation#web-server-configuration) for non-nginx

### Initialize database

```bash
# this script assumes you can connect passwordless as root
$ ./bin/db_setup.sh
```

### Install packages and build assets

```bash
# will also install composer and yarn
$ ./build.sh
```

At this point you should be able to access the site via whatever webserver you configured

## 2\. Automated setup for Ubuntu

### Create a fresh Ubuntu environment

On your server, a virtual machine, whatever.

### Clone the git repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/ppy/osu-web.git
```

### Run automated configuration

Note these script are intended to be run in a _sandboxed environment_; do not run on a shared development system without first understanding what is being done.

```bash
$ sudo ./bootstrap.sh
$ ./build.sh
```

You can then run the standalone php server from inside the `public` folder:

```
php -S 127.0.0.1:8080
```

## 3\. Using Docker

- First, install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- Export required environment variable `UID` (`export UID`).

  - Make sure to do this before using any of docker-compose commands.
  - Alternatively add the command to shell initialisation file like `~/.profile` or `~/.zshrc`.

- Run `docker-compose up` in the main directory.
- Due to the nature of Docker (a container is killed when the command running in it finishes), the Yarn container will be run in watch mode.
- Do note that the supplied Elasticsearch container uses a high (1+ GB) amount of RAM. Ensure that your system (or virtual machine, if running on Windows/macOS) has a necessary amount of memory allocated (at least 2 GB). If you can't (or don't want to), you can comment out the relevant elasticsearch lines in `docker-compose.yml`.
- To run any of the below commands, make sure you are in the docker container: `docker-compose exec php sh`.

# Development

## Creating your initial user

In the repository directory:

```php
$ php artisan tinker
>>> (new App\Libraries\UserRegistration(["username" => "yourusername", "user_email" => "your@email.com", "password" => "yourpassword"]))->save();
```

## Generating assets

Using Laravel's [Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/mix).

```bash
# build assets (should be done automatically if using docker)
$ yarn run development
```

Note that if you use the bundled docker-compose setup, yarn/webpack will be already run in watch mode, and you will only need to run the `lang:js` and `ziggy:generate` artisan commands whenever you need to regenerate these helper files.

## Reset the database + seeding sample data

```
$ php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

Run the above command to rebuild the database and seed with sample data. In order for the seeder to seed beatmaps, you must enter a valid osu! API key into your `.env` configuration file as it obtains beatmap data from the osu! API.

## Continuous asset generation while developing

To continuously generate assets as you make changes to files (less, coffeescript) you can run `webpack` in `watch` mode.

```
$ yarn run watch
```

# Documentation

```bash
$ php artisan apidoc:generate
```

Documentation will be generated in the `docs` folder in both html and markdown formats.
