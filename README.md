=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ppy/osu-web.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ppy/osu-web)

The future face of osu!.

Requirements
------------

[Vagrant 1.7+](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) or equivalent development environment.

Deploying
---------

1. Clone repository
2. Open shell and point to checkout directory
3. `cd vagrant; vagrant up`
4. wait patiently
5. Access the site from http://localhost:8080/.

*Note that you can get things running without vagrant. It should be pretty straightforward, but if you run into problems don't hesitate to open an issue asking for help!*

### Creating user

    c:\osuweb\vagrant> vagrant ssh
    $ cd /data/osu\!web
    $ hhvm artisan tinker
    >>> App\Models\User::create(["username" => "yourusername", "user_password" => password_hash(md5("yourpassword"), PASSWORD_BCRYPT)]);

### Generating assets

    c:\osu-web\vagrant> vagrant ssh
    $ cd /data/osu\!web
    $ hhvm artisan lang:js resources/assets/js/messages.js
    $ ./node_modules/.bin/gulp
