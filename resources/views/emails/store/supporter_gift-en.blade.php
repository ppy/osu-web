Hey there {{ $giftee->username }},


Someone has just gifted you an osu! supporter tag!
Thanks to them, you now have access osu!direct and other supporter benefits for the next {{ trans_choice('months', $length )}}
You can find out more details on these features at http://osu.ppy.sh/p/support.
The person who gifted you this tag may choose to remain anonymous, so they have not been mentioned in this notification
(But you likely already know who it is ;).

Regards,
osu! Management
