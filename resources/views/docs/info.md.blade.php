# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for osu!api v2. You can use this API to get information on various circles and those who click them.

Note that while we endeavour to keep this documentation up to date, consider it a work-in-progress and note that it will likely contain errors.

If you notice any errors in the documentation or encounter problems using the API, please check for (or create if necessary) [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/issues). Alternatively, you can ask in `#osu-web` [on the development discord](https://discord.gg/ppy).

Code examples are provided in the dark area to the right, you can use the tabs at the top of the page to switch between bash and javascript samples.

# Terms of Use

Use the API for good. Don't overdo it. If in doubt, ask before (ab)using :). _this section may expand as necessary_.

Current rate limit is set at an insanely high 1200 requests per minute, with burst capability of up to 200 beyond that. If you require more, you probably fall into the above category of abuse. If you are doing more than 60 requests a minute, you should probably give [peppy](mailto:pe@ppy.sh) a yell.

# Wrappers

Below is a list of some language-specific wrappers maintained by the community. Your mileage may vary when using them â€“ please report any issues to the wrapper first before reporting back to us.

# Endpoint

## Base URL and API Versions

This is combined with the base endpoint to determine where requests should be sent.

URL                             | Status
------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------
{{ config('app.url') }}/api/v2/      | current
{{ config('app.url') }}/api/         | _legacy api provided by the old site, will be deprecated soon_

## Language

Language for the response is determined by `Accept-Language` header when specified. Specifying `*` or not setting the header will set the language to user configured language when accessing API as a user.
