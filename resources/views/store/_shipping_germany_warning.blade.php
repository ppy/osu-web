    <p><strong>NOTE TO GERMAN CUSTOMERS</strong></p>

    <p>
        We have recently been notified of issues regarding deliveries within Germany, possibly due to a change in German customs regulations. Multiple cases have been reported where packages are not delivered to the addressee, but instead to a customs house. The addressee is then sent a notice to pick up the item in person and pay an import sales tax. Unfortunately international customs procedures are out of our control, but <strong>please take this into account when placing your order</strong>.
