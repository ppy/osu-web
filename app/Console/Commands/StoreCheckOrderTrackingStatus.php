We have been tracking your order and noticed that it is currently in the state of \"{$thisStatus}\".

This means it has likely reached your local post office, but you weren't around to collect the package. Please check your letterbox for any notices of missed packages, and if there is no sign of such a notice please contact or visit your local post office and enquire using your tracking number ({$code}) to ensure you receive your order successfully. If no action is taken in 7 days, they are likely to return the package to us, so it is very important that you follow up on this.

You can check the current tracking status here: https://store.ppy.sh/store/invoice/{$o->order_id}.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reply to this email.

The osu!store team", 'From: "osu!store team" <osustore@ppy.sh>');
